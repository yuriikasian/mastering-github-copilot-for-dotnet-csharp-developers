## Step 4: Using comments to generate code with Copilot

_Nicely done utilizing the Copilot tab!_ :partying_face:

You now have leveraged the Copilot quick tab auto-suggest as well as the Copilot hub to accept AI generated suggestions.

Now lets see how you can leverage comments to generate Copilot suggestions!

### ⌨️ Activity: Generate Copilot suggested code from comments.

1. From inside the codespace in the Solution Explorer, right click on the project, create a new file. 

> Note: If you closed the Codespace from above please open it back up or create a new Codespace.

2. Select **Class** and name the file `Comments.cs`
3. Type the following comment into the file inside of the **Comments** class:
   ```
   // create a method that generates a comment for a given skill
   ```
4. Press `enter` to go to a new line.
5. Copilot will suggest a code block.
6. Hover over the red squiggly and select the `...`

   > **Note**
   > If you don't see the copilot code block suggestion or the red squiggly and the three dots `...`, you can type `control + enter` to bring up the GitHub Copilot completions panel.

7. Click `Open Completions Panel`. Copilot will synthesise around 10 different code suggestions. You should see something like this:

8. Find a solution you like and click `Accept Solution`.
9. Your `Comments.cs` file will be updated with your solution.

### ⌨️ Activity: Push code to your repository from the codespace

Let's use GitHub Copilot to summarize our changes and then commit the code. 

1. Open the **Source Control** tab
2. Tap on the ✨ button in the **Message** entry for Copilot to generate your message.
